# AMA with Cross-Chain Communities
To build relationship, raise awareness & understanding between chains' communities in Indonesia
To learn from each other chain and inspire one another, so that we can pick good ideas to implement

***F9 Proposal:*** https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416801


## Summary
This AMA with Cross-Chain Communities in Indonesia will make people understand better about Cardano and what we do. At the time we also could learn many things from other chains and community about how they build their ecosystem. We could share and learn about many topics, like governance, community building, NFT, metaverse, DAO, and many other things. These AMA hopefully could be an eye opening meeting that could build better understanding, awareness and relationship to other chains and communities in Indonesia. 

## Why Is It Important?

This project can help so many people to understand Cardano ecosystem better and also help Cardano Indonesia communities to have a wiser knowledges about other chains and projects. It will build relationship and also positive spirit to support each other. It is also an opportunities to know about so many project that we can also implement at Cardano ecosystem and projects.

## How Does Success Look Like?

If funded, the AMA will be held for 3 months: September-November 2022. Date and time will be discussed with community partner. Every AMA will be separated into 2 sections 2 hours; 1 hours material and discussion, 1 hours Q&A session. The AMA could be attended by people from both communities, so they can learn from each other and they can ask questions that could inspire and expand their understanding about each chains.
